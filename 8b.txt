A)Sampling Raster data using Points or Polygons
A raster grid of maximum temperature in the US is given, we need to extract the temperature at all urban 
areas and also we will calculate the average temperature for each county in the US.
Required dataset:
us.tmax_nohads_ll_20140525_float.tif 2013_Gaz_ua_national.zip tl_2013_us_county.zip
Required Plugin:
Point sampling tool
1.Add raster layer “us.tmax_nohads_ll_20140525_float.tif”.
2.Click on identify feature tool and then click anywhere on the image, we will see the temperature value at that
 location as value or band 1 in left pane or in the canvas area.
3.Add delimited text layer “2013_Gaz_ua_national.txt” which is present in 2013_Gaz_ua_national folder.
4.On next window click on browse button and select 2013_Gaz_ua_national.txt file, select tab under custom delimiters,
 the point coordinates are in Latitude and Longitude, so
select INTPTLONG as X field and INTPTLAT as Y field. Also check the Use spatial index box and then click on OK. 
Then select CRS as WGS 84.
5.Now we are ready to extract temperature value from raster layer, but before moving further we need to install 
“Point sampling tool” plugin if it is not installed.
6.Click on plugin  analysis  point sampling tool.
7.In point sampling dialog box, select 2013_Gaz_ua_national as layer containing sampling point, here we need to select
 fields from input layer that we want in our output layer. Select GEOID and NAME fields. We can sample values from multiple
 band but here we have only one band so select us.tmax_nohads_II_20140525_float: band 1. Set location and give name for output 
vector layer as max_temperature_at_urban_locations.shp, then click on Ok button. Once the process is completed click on close button.
 Also select WGS 84 as CRS on next screen.
8.New layer is loaded in QGIS, now again we can click on identify tool and click on any point on layer to see the values
 associated with it.
9.First part of analysis is over, now we can remove unnecessary layers from qgis. Right click on max_temperature_at_urban_locations 
in layer pane and select remove, similarly remove 2013_Gaz_ua_national layer.
10.Now add vector layer “tl_2013_us_county.shp”.
11.The above layer is added in QGIS, but it is in EPSG: 4269 projection (we can check in property window) which doesn’t match with
 the raster layer, so we will reproject this layer to EPSG: 4326. Right click on this layer and select Save as…
12.In save as dialog box select format as ESRI Shapefile, set location for output file and give name of output file as counties.shp. 
Click on Change button to set the CRS and select WGS 84, check the add saved file to map and then click on Ok.
13.Uncheck the original layer from layer pane now.
14.Install “Zonal statistics plugins” if it is not installed.
15.Click on raster  zonal statistics  zonal statistics.
16.Select us.tmax_nohads_ll_20140525_float as raster layer and counties as polygon layer containing the zones. Enter ZS_ as the output
 column prefix. Click on Ok. It may take some time.
17.Once the processing is completed, select counties layer from layer pane and select identify tool and click on any county polygon. 
We can see three new attributes as ZS_count, ZS_mean and
ZS_sum. These attributes contain count of raster pixels, mean of raster pixel values and sum of raster pixel values respectively.
 We are going to use ZS_mean.
18.Let’s change the style of this layer to create temperature map. Double click on counties layer from layer pane to open its
 property window.
19.Click on style tab. Select graduated style and ZS_mean column. Select color ramp and mode. Click on classify button to create the classes.
 Click on Ok.
20.We will see the county polygons styled using average maximum temperature extracted from the raster grid.
